ircwebchat is a webserver that hosts a web-based irc client. 
Users can login from multiple locations and access their IRC session.

The server is written in Go. 

The ircwebchat package exposes a Register() function that can be
used to register its http handlers, so it may be easily adapted
for use in other Go servers.

The frontend is written in Javascript. It currently requires websockets,
for communication. The UI is built using react.js


#Build Instructions
Building the server requires Go be installed and configured correctly.
